# Sudoku_Solver_Python

## Aim: To solve any 9x9 grid sudoku puzzle using Python

## Rules of the game: Fill in all the empty cells with the numbers 1 to 9 but also ensuring there are no repetitions in any rows, columns and individual 3x3 grids


### Input of the function: list of 9 lists 

[ [v00, v01, v02, ..., v08],
  [v10, v11, v12, ..., v18],
  ...
  [v80, v81, v82, ..., v88] ]


Using the 0-index:

Ex 1. v00 is the value from row[0] and column[0].

Ex 2. v12 is the value from row[1] and column[2].



The 9x9 grid will be filled with numbers from 0 to 9. The empty cells are represented with the number zero -> 0. 


### Output: True and the completed solution, False otherwise
